1. The world is full of abundance. 
2. People are good by default and usually want to help. No person desires evil. 
3. Hurtful behavior comes from pain, not evil. It’s a sign of lacking strength or courage
4. Everyone carries their own unique story and their own battles.
5. If it doesn’t break physics, it’s possible.
6. Optimism by default. There's no reason to be pesimistic.
7. You can talk to anyone, and they will talk back.
8. You can just do things. 
9. Hiding behind the trauma is an excuse. The past doesn't define your future.  
both the past and the future don't exist.
10. Growth comes from discomfort.
