# My life changed in 2023

Beginning of 2023, I was the most miserable person ever. Surrounded by fake friends, overworked, on antidepressants, sad, stressed, fighting imposter syndrome every day.  
And then I had the most absurd year of my life.  
Here’s how it happened ⬇️

Beginning of the year, I was working ~15 hours/day. Weekdays, weekends, didn't matter. I wasn't doing ANYTHING for myself. I was actively avoiding social
events, gyms, or anything that could release the tension. Every single thing was just wrong.{' '}

**❄️ January:**  
My GF convinced me to hide in the mountains for a few days.  
My therapist and mentors made me realise I was getting close to burnout and that my environment was toxic. I started having problems with long-term memory due to chronic elevated levels of cortisol.

**🙃 February:**

Received another big hit, when it turned out I was leaving “my company”.  
I left people I considered my "friends" and they didn't make it easy.

Felt like the biggest failure. I was pushed out in just 2 weeks.

Bought an El Clasico ticket as a consolation prize.

**💻 March:**

Leaving the company, I promised myself next time build stuff with code, not Zapier. I started learning programming. At the end of March, I was fluent in HTML, CSS & was starting JS.

I met with friends in Barcelona and visited my fav Nice to do some cycling.

**👨‍⚖️ April:**

Mentally destroyed I left for Asia. Didn’t want to deal with people anymore.

My "friends" decided to go after me, so I had to hire a lawyer for the first time in my life to protect myself from other people.

Timezone difference made me talk with lawyers every night.

That's how I discovered Digital Nomading, a.k.a everything can be your office if they squeeze you hard enough 🤡.

**🚢 May:**

I visited Taiwan, an island that I love unconditionally. I was coding daily to
learn NextJS and ship products.

**🏃🏻‍♂️ June:**

Just before going back to Poland to run in a 400km relay race, I shipped my first Product. It was sht, but it didn’t matter. It made me realise what’s possible and taught me so much. More coding, more grinding.

This could be the best sunset of the year.

**⛰️ July:**

I travelled to Senja (north Norway) alone to reset my mind. I was starting to feel really good, so I dropped antidepressants after 2 years of taking my pills every day.

The midnight sun was spectacular.

**🚴‍♀️ August:**

Shipped my second product, better than before. Not perfect, but I was moving forward. Then I moved to Amsterdam for 3 weeks to keep an eye of my friends's apartment.

**💵 September:**

September was for Croatia. Also, found out that Mallorca is the place to live someday!

First coding money! For the first time since I started coding, someone decided to pay me for it. Felt like a greater achievement than securing VC funding.

**🌴 October:**

More coding money. I’m starting to realise my superpower lies in building rapid MVPs. I doubled down on it, building simple apps for clients FAST.

But this was the big one for another reason: I finally moved to Bali to reclaim my life.

**☀️ November** was the calmest one. No trips, no fancy experiences, just healthy routines, making me happy.

Joined Hackagu!

I’m happily shipping, grinding every day, working out, meeting with friends and enjoying life.

**🚀 December:**

Was sort of the same.

Everything is in place. I’m earning money with code, I work out every day, I’m healthy, happy and open to learn. Life just feels good.

Anyways, maybe it's cheesy, but who cares.

I know there’s a lot of people struggling with life. It’s worth working hard to get your sht together. Find a therapist, lift weights, get morning sunlight, sleep well, eat healthy and talk to people. Life’s hard for everyone.
And that's how I ended here.

Happy, healthy, living my life. Read the full story ⬇️

And remember to leave a follow! I'm gonna hit 300 this year 😆
